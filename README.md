# Android Sample Project (JetPack Compose)
This repository contains a sample Android App that shows Plants data from a Mock API in Home Screen and plants from loacal db in Local Screen. This is a sample app that shows how different jetpack libraries interact with each other. The app code follows SOLID principles by implementing Clean Architecture. The basic purpose of this project is to show how Android apps are structured and developed at [DevCrew.IO](https://devcrew.io/).

## Clean Architecture Implementation
The project has the following three packages.
- **Data**
Layer that contains repositories, API (Network), Persistence DB.
- **Domain**
Layer that  contains Entities, Use Cases, and Repository interfaces.
- **Presentation**
Layer that contains UI related stuff like Views and ViewModel etc
